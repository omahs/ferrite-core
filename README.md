## Ferrite is a cryptocurrency that seeks to enable fast and free payments.  <br>

![ferrite-core-main-4ka-8k-4](https://github.com/koh-gt/ferrite-core/assets/101822992/55820629-5911-429a-ab53-20d95561d5dc)


## Features:
### Affordable transactions -
Fees are denominated in fractions of Ferrite, which amounts to a negligible cost.

### Uncensorable text messaging storage -
Text inscribed on the blockchain are distributed to every node and stored permanently, allowing for censorship proofing.
Use [Ferritext](https://github.com/koh-gt/ferritext) OP_RETURN tool to send messages.
Inscription explorer will be launched soon.

### 1 minute block time - 
Transactions are received instantly and can be confirmed within minutes.

### Dynamic difficulty adjustment (after height 250,000) - 
Difficulty adjusts every block, adapting quickly to difficulty fluctuations.
> If mining hashrate spikes, difficulty will quickly rise to limit supply.
> If mining hashrate plummets, difficulty will quickly drop to encourage mining.

### Limited supply - 
There will be no more than 60,221,400 FEC - [View current supply](https://explorer.ferritecoin.org)
A maximum of $100$ FEC (Ferrite coins) are mined in a block. 
This number will halve every $301107$ blocks, or about 8 months considering block propagation time.

### Transparent - 
No pre-mine - Linux Executables are uploaded on public Telegram and Discord groups as early as block 120 (2 hours), with full migration to Github by block 3000 (50 hours).

### Decentralised - 
Ferrite has no owner. The miners shall decide the fate of the network.

### Pseudonymous -
Nobody knows who owns the mined coins, nor who sent the coins. Unless you identify as the owner of the public address, you maintain anonymity.
With Ferrite's MWEB implementation on Ferrite transactions can be made private and confidential at a time where exchanges are mandating strict KYC and AML measures. (active as of height 150,000 on 6 Jul 2023)

### Scrypt Algorithm -  
Reuse obsolete Ferrite, Dogecoin and Ethereum / Classic miners to mine Ferrite. Originally designed to be ASIC resistant.

### Why the name Ferrite Core?
The humble ferrite core is cheap and hidden from view. Most people have never heard about it, yet it is what allows our electric generators, switches and radio antennas to function. It has high magnetic permeability allowing for magnetic fields to pass through, yet has low electrical conductivity which reduces eddy current losses. Most importantly, the ferrite core possesses these properties while being cheap and safe to use. This makes the ferrite core suitable for being used as magnetic cores for electromagnet coils. 

Bitcoin is considered as digital gold, Ferrite as digital silver. Ferrite is ferrite. 
> In the real world, we use coins made of ferrous base metals because gold and silver are too precious for circulation. 

A cheap and low barrier to entry will allow for mass adoption.
Similarly, I hope that Ferrite Core will be used for fast, low volume transactions as well as small amount remittances for the unbanked people in developing nations to avoid exuberant remittance costs. 
A low price will ensure that Ferrite coins and its fees stay affordable.  
The Ferrite coin logo is the IEEE-315 circuit diagram symbol for a ferrite bead.

There are so many coins out there, what makes this special? - Nothing for now. This coin is created as a non-profit experimental software. Ferrite Core is just copied code, pre-generated code, and lines of edited code from multiple sources. Ferrite coins, like other cryptocurrencies, have zero intrinsic value. Do not invest more than what you can afford to lose.

High adoption rates need not be expensive, and high market cap is not the way to having high adoption.
How many people are in cryptocurrency for its technological features rather than its profit potential?

### Graphs
This coin would either be very active or completely inactive in a year or two. For the sake of practicality the graphs will not extend beyond the time scope of 750 days. This should be enough to capture the first 3 halvings.  

The total coin supply per halving epoch can be found using this equation.

$$\sum_{i=0}^{33}301,107\left(\frac{100}{2^i}\right)\approx60,221,400$$
